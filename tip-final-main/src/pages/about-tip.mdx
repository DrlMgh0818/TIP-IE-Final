<h3 class="text-center text-accent">History</h3>

On February 8, 1962, a group of educators headed by Engineer Demetrio A. Quirino Jr. established the TECHNOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF THE PHILIPPINES as a private non-sectarian stock institute.

T.I.P. laid down its objectives based on the vision of its founder and chairman Demetrio A. Quirino Jr.: 
1. To maintain a high standard of instruction; 
2. To bring within the reach of the masses the blessings of higher education; and 
3. To cooperate with the government in the implementation of its economic and social amelioration programs.

T.I.P. committed itself to educating and developing men and women who could turn the wheels of progress and industry. It offered courses such as Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, and Commerce. It also offered Industrial Education, Industrial Arts, Liberal Arts, High School, and technical-vocational courses. Its first site was the Lorenzana Bldg. in Quiapo, Manila.

T.I.P. had an initial enrollment of 2,400, which steadily increased, prompting the school to lease other buildings. In 1967, it set up its main site at 888 G. Puyat St., Quiapo, Manila. T.I.P. then directed itself toward specialization in the field of technology. In 1977, it offered a two-year associate course in Marine Engineering. In 1980, the Liberal Arts, Education, and high school programs were phased out to make way for the school’s new thrust. In 1981, additional buildings were leased to accommodate the student population which already exceeded 23,000.

T.I.P. opened in 1983; its Quezon City campus is at 20th Avenue, Cubao. T.I.P. QC, through the years, acquired adjacent properties, including a frontage along Aurora Boulevard. T.I.P. Manila also acquired ownership of two (2) major sites totaling 2.3 hectares, namely, the P. Casal and the Arlegui properties.

As of School Year 2013-2014, the Quezon City campus has 10 buildings spread out in the 2.8-hectare site, while the Manila Campus has three (3) main buildings at P. Casal and a six-storey building at Arlegui.
