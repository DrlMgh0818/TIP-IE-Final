# Technological Institute of the Philippines Industrial Engineering Department Website

Welcome to the Industrial Engineering Department website for the Technological Institute of the Philippines (TIP). This website aims to provide information and resources for students, faculty, and visitors interested in the field of Industrial Engineering.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the development of this website, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your system. You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd industrial-engineering-website
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To run the development server and view changes in real-time, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev4development
```

This will start the development server and open your default browser to preview the website. Any changes you make to the source code will be automatically reflected in the browser.

### Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your website to a production environment, use the following command to build the optimized production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate a production-ready build of your website in the `dist` directory, which can then be deployed to a web server.
